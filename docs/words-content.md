# Content

<hr/>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:75%;color:orange">24 July 2022</p>

```{admonition} content

   (_noun_) The things that are held or included in something. [^oxford]
```

[^oxford]: From the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/).


## Origin

Late Middle English, from the medieval Latin _contentum_.

## Example

> "The Daily Mirror is read by people who think they run the country, the Guardian is read by people who think they ought to run the country, the Times is read by people who actually do run the country, the Daily Mail is read by the wives of the people who run the country, the Financial Times is read by people who own the country, the Morning Star is read by people who think the country ought to be run by another country and the Daily Telegraph is read by people who think it is."

## Notes

_Content_ made its way into late Middle English from the medieval Latin _contentum_ (plural _contenta_, meaning 'things contained'), which is the neuter past participle of _continere_ (from _con-_ 'altogether' + _tenere_ 'to hold'). Thus, 'content' is not only some thing, it is also something that goes well together with some other thing. Gibberish isn't content; twittering doesn't produce content.
