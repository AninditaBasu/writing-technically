```{admonition} ephemeral

   (_adjective_) Lasting for a very short time. [^oxford]
```

[^oxford]: From the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/).

## Origin

Late 16th century, from the Greek word _ephēmeros_ which means 'lasting only a day'. The neuter form of _ephēmeros_ also gives the singular _ephemeron_ (plural, _ephemera_), which originally denoted a plant said by ancient writers to last only one day, or an insect with a short lifespan.

## Example

> "But what does that mean – _ephemeral_?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.
> 
> "It means, _which is in danger of speedy disappearance_."
> 
> "Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"
> 
> "Certainly it is."
