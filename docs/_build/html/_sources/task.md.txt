# Sending bottled messages

A message in a bottle is a form of communication in which a message is sealed in a container, such as a glass bottle, and released into a body of water, such as the sea.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you're within walking distance of the sea. Then, gather the following things:

- A glass bottle with a lid
- A piece of parchment that can be rolled up to fit inside the glass bottle
- A quill pen
- A bottle of ink
- An oilskin pouch that can fit inside the glass bottle

## Steps

1. Clean the glass bottle thoroughly and put it out to dry.
2. Dip the quill pen into the ink and write out the following message on the parchment.

    ```
    Dear Mr. Potter,

    We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
    Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.	

    Term begins on 1 September. 
	
    We await your owl by no later than 31 July.

    Yours sincerely,

    Minerva McGonagall
    Deputy Headmistress"
    ```

3. Wait for the ink to dry, and then fold the parchment and place it inside the oilskin pouch.
4. Place the pouch inside the glass bottle and seal it.
5. Determine the time of the next high tide by referring to the local tide table.
6. At the next high tide, walk out to the sea and throw the glass bottle out as far as you can.

The tide will carry the bottle out to the high sea and deposit it at the shore of the receiver. Wait for a reply.
