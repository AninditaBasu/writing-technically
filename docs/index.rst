.. epigraph::

   Oh, lift me as a wave, a leaf, a cloud!

   I fall upon the thorns of life! I bleed!

   A heavy weight of hours has chain'd and bow'd

   One too like thee: tameless, and swift, and proud.

   Make me thy lyre, even as the forest is:

   Drive my dead thoughts over the universe

   Like wither'd leaves to quicken a new birth!

   And, by the incantation of this verse,

   Scatter, as from an unextinguish'd hearth

   Ashes and sparks, my words ...

   -- Shelley, Percy Bysshe. "Ode to the West Wind".
