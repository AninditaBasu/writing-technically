## Notes

These days, managers manage people and companies but a very long time ago, when people were still fighting each other with swords and lances, what needed real management were horses. The earliest sense of 'manage' in English was 'to handle or train a horse', or put it through the exercises of the _man√®ge_. This French word, used in English to mean 'an area in which horses and riders are trained' and 'horsemanship', is at root of 'manage'. Both these words, English and French, go back through Italian to Latin _manus_, meaning 'hand'. _Manus_ is also the source of several other words such as 'manacles' (which restrain your hands), 'manicure' (care of your hands), 'manipulate' (to handle something), 'manuscript' (something written by hand), and 'manual' (either done with your hands or with a handbook).
