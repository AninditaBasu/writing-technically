Filling mechanism in pens

The ink in pens can be replenished by three methods, depending on the type of the pen: lever, pneumatic, and eyedrop.

A pen has two parts: a nib and an ink reservoir. When the ink supply in the reservoir is over, the nib can no longer leave any marks on paper.


Lever

A small metal strip, fixed on the pen body, is used as a lever. When lifted, the point of the metal strip is pressed against the ink reservoir inside the pen body. This action creates a sucking force by which ink is drawn inside the reservoir through the nib. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht7meVolUVo.
