.. epigraph::

   When I have fears that I may cease to be

   Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain,

   Before high-pil√®d books, in charactery,

   Hold like rich garners the full ripened grain;

   ...

   And think that I may never live to trace

   Their shadows ...

   -- John Keats, *When I have fears that I may cease to be*
