# Navigate

<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:75%;color:orange">17 February 2023</p>

```{admonition} navigate

   (_verb, with object_) To move on, over, or through (water, air, or land) in a ship or aircraft.
   
   (_verb, without object_) To direct or manage a ship, aircraft, or guided missile on its course. [^oxford]

[^oxford]: From the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/).


## Origin

Late 16th century, from the Latin word _nāvigātus_

## Example

## Notes

_Navigate_ is from the Latin _nāvigātus_, which is the past participle of _nāvigāre_ ('to sail'), derived from _nāvis_ ('ship').

The word _navis_ is related to the Greek _naus_ ('ship'), which is an ancestor of the English word _noise_.

Originally, _noise_ in English meant 'sickness'. It's derived from the Latin _nausea_. 

_Noise_ was used colloquially for the hullabaloo or donnybrook that happens when someone is sick (more specifically, seasick, which was what _nausea_ originally implied). The word passed into Old French as _noise_, which then developed to mean 'noisy dispute'. The modern French _noise_ has retained the sense of 'dispute', while the modern English _noise_ means 'noise' ('unpleasant sound').

When a user complains about an app or a site being difficult to navigate, one may well wonder whether the UI is a tad too noisy or nauseous.
