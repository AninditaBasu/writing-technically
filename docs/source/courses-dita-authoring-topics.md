# Tagging in DITA

<hr/>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:75%;color:orange">14 April 2024</p>

In a [previous lesson](courses-dita-authoring-infotype.md), you learnt about arranging information into discrete buckets called topic types. In [another lesson](courses-dita-authoring-tags.md), you learnt about tags. In this lesson, you'll use these learnings to create DITA topics.

After collecting your information and broadly separating them into concepts, tasks, and references, you'll now put them in DITA.

To do so more easily, download and install a DITA-aware authoring tool called [XMLMind](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml). The Personal Edition is free to use, with the caveat that XMLMind will randomly add an alphabet or two to some words here and there. This should be fine because the focus of these lessons isn't writing _per se_ but becoming familiar with writing in DITA.

```{admonition} Focus is on DITA, not the tool

   You might be tempted to become an expert user of XMLMind Editor. However, remember that there are several DITA writing tools available and, in a real-life techwriting scenario, the choice of the tool is made by people way above our paygrade. The intention of using XMLMind Editor for these lessons is:
   
   -  It's free to use.
   -  It can be used to generate HTML output, looking at which you'll get a feel of what the default DITA output looks like.
   
   Retain your focus on the writing part, not the tool part.

```

In the [next lesson](xxx.md), you'll learn about how to assemble discrete topics into a book.
