```{admonition} write

   (_verb_) Mark (letters, words, or other symbols) on a surface, typically paper, with a pen, pencil, or similar implement. [^oxford]
```

[^oxford]: From the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.lexico.com/).


## Origin

Old English _wrītan_, which means 'to score, or form (letters) by carving, write'.

## Notes

The word comes from Old English _writan_, which is a word of Germanic origin, related to the German word _reissen_, meaning 'sketch' or 'drag'.

It is, thus, evident that many many years ago, writing included sketching and drawing — just like technical writing does today.
